# DEPOC

A comprehensive management system built by a business owner, tailored for small Brazilian businesses.

This project took shape in response to a specific need in my last brick-and-mortar store. After closing the business, I continued developing and refining the system. We're currently buinding:

- **api** – Django RESTful api.
- **depopy** – Depoc Python library.

This repository serves as the **hub for ecosystem-wide documentation**, including architecture, development standards, and shared tooling. For system-specific docs, refer to each project's repo.

## Documentation

- [ADR Template](/adr/) – Architecture Decision Record template.
- [Development](/development/) – Code conventions, commit style, and workflows.

## Core Repositories

- [api](https://github.com/depoc/api)
- [depopy](https://github.com/depoc/depopy)
